# Loft

## What's here?

This repo contains the source code to the entirety of Loft. We plan to build this script editor as best we can to be a cross between Vim and Visual Studio Code "vscode".

The source code (and the only repo containing) contains the Pheonix editor's source code. Pheonix is the backend, heavy lifter of the main editor. If you plan to edit anything related to the editor we recommend you start there.

## Contributing

We recommend you start in our discord server, as I'm too lazy to write this twice.

## Extensions?

probably not
Maybe one day but I prefer only verified implementations.
If there are extensions you'd have to download it from its original source as I don't want to make a public storage for all extensions.
